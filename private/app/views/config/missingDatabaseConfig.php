<h3>I couldn't find your databaseConfig file!</h3><br />
<p>
I was expecting to find it in at <b><tt>/private/config/databaseConfig.php</tt></b>,
but it wasn't there.
</p>
<p>
It may be that you haven't yet filled it out yet; that's okay though, since I can help you do that.
<ol>
<li>In the <b><tt>/private/config</tt></b> there's a file called 
<b><tt>databaseConfig.php.sample</tt></b>.</li>
<li>Copy <b><tt>databaseConfig.php.sample</tt></b> to <b><tt>databaseConfig.php</tt></b></li>
<li>Now, the defaults from the sample file might work for you, but just to be sure, you'll want to
edit the file and stick in the appropriate values.</li>
<li>That should do it!  Try reloading this page, and you should see sweet, sweet, database-driven
love.</li>
</ol>
